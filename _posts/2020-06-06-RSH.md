title: Raytracing Spherical Harmonics
---

Suzanne is the name of a built-in primitive one can generate with [blender](https://www.blender.org/), and it looks like this:

If you choose a center point $$c$$ within the mesh, you can calculate the distance to each surface point $$p$$ from $$c$$.
We could define a function 

$$  s(\omega) : \mathbb{R}^3 \mapsto \mathbb{R}  $$

that for any given direction $$\omega$$ gives us the distance to the surface seen from $$c$$ into this direction. Let us ignore the fact that in a given direction there could be multiple layers of the surface, or in some directions there could be no surface at all (so a hole), for a moment. Then we could represent Suzanne by this distance function. 

If we then define a ray, having an origin $$o_r$$ and a direction $$d_r$$, both located in Suzanne's coordinate system $$T_{Suzanne}$$ (i.e., with $$c$$ being the origin), along which we can sweep with a scalar $$t$$:

$$ r(t) = o_r + d_r t $$

and the distance of a point which is located in $$T_{Suzanne}$$ to the origin:

$$ l(p) = ||p|| $$

we can formulate the intersection between the ray and the surface as 

$$ l(r(t)) = s(r(t))$$

so we are trying to find a $$t$$ so that the length of the vector described by the position on the ray, located in $$T_{Suzanne}$$, corresponds to the distance of Suzanne's surface to $$c$$ in the direction that is given by the point $$r(t)$$, in other words, $$r(t)$$ being the point where the ray intersects the surface. 

How to find this intersection ? Let us talk about that later and first give an actual definition of the function $$s(r(t))$$ (Suzanne's surface)!

I would like to try use spherical harmonics as an approximated representation of the surface.

I read about them when studying [_Precomputed Radiance Transfer_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/566570.566612), which brilliantly takes advantage of the ability to combine two spherical harmonics by just multiplying their coefficients. The following method has not much todo with the mentioned paper but uses spherical harmonics as well.

For a spherical harmonics representation you choose a number of bands (in my case 6) resulting in some coefficients (in my case 36) to represent the function. This is similar to storing a polynomial like $$ax^2+bx$$ by storing $$a$$ and $$b$$.

This would enable us to represent Suzanne's surface _approximately_, by loading 36 coefficients $$f_i$$ and evaluating the spherical harmonics basis functions $$y_i$$:

$$ s(\omega) \approx \sum_i^n f_i y_i(\omega) $$

In this post i don't want to talk about the projection of the surface mesh into spherical harmonics space, so i assume we've already done that and have 36 coefficients that describe our surface.

While the storage costs are relatively low (36 floats (coefficients) compared to Suzanne's default 507 vertices (3 floats each)), the evaulation costs of the spherical basis functions $$y_i$$ can be quite high (don't want to think of ray-triangle intersections on the other hand though). Fortunately there was _Peter-Pike Sloan's_ [_Efficient Spherical Harmonic Evaluation_](https://www.ppsloan.org/publications/SHJCGT.pdf), providing the world with code to generate c code that evaluates the basis functions faster (boiled down to some polynomials).

Now, a simple and also working algorithm to find the intersection would be to take discrete samples along the ray, testing for each sample whether we are "inside" the body described by the surface, or outside, by evaluating $$l$$ and $$s$$ and comparing them. The first time we land inside, we approximately found our intersection position. An impressive reference implementation can be found [here](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsfXWH). The disadvantage of this method is the number of steps one needs to perform to get an appropriate quality. In the link it is a for loop with 200 iterations (remember this is executed in the fragment shader, and needs to be repeated for every object that has a spherical harmonics representation).

We could also use Newton's method: for a given function $$f(x)$$ and a first guess $$x_0$$ for its root, a better approximation to the function's root is

$$x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$$

so in our case $$f$$ is the difference between $$l$$ and $$s$$, evaluated for a point on the ray $$r$$ with a given $$t$$:

$$f(t) = l(r(t)) - s(r(t))$$

But ugh, to apply Newton's method, we need the function's derivative, and therefore we need to differentiate spherical harmonics. _Yes, please!_  replies the well-schooled mathematician. _Well, no thank you_ answers the suffering programmer who doesn't only come up with all that theory but later needs to implement it... Instead, we calculate a poor man's derivative by evaluating the surface function $$s(r(t))$$ at two distinct positions $$t$$ and $$t+\epsilon$$, and then subtract the results to get a delta and thereby an approximation of the derivative:

$$ s'(r(t)) \approx s(r(t+\epsilon)) - s(r(t))$$

Note: this means, for every iteration of the Newton method, we need to evaluate the spherical harmonics terms two times (compared to one time per iteration when performing the simple ray marching)!

The other part is differentiating the euclidian norm $$l(r(t))$$ using the chain rule:

$$ l(r(t)) = ||r(t)|| = \sqrt{r(t) \cdot r(t)} $$

$$l'(r(t)) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{r(t) \cdot r(t)}}J_{dot} \cdot d_r$$

where $$J_{dot} = \begin{pmatrix}2r(t)_x & 2r(t)_y & 2r(t)_z\end{pmatrix} $$ is the jacobian matrix - so all partial derivatives - of the dot product, which happens to be a row vector.
$$d_r$$ is the derivative of $$r(t)$$, which is just the ray's direction vector. Altogether we luckily get a scalar output of this, and that colludes well with the approximated spherical harmonics derivative which is also a scalar. 

**After the dust has settled**, to get a verbal overview of the above, we wanted to find an intersection point of a ray with a surface, so we formulate a function that describes the distance of a point on the ray to the surface, and try to find **the** point on the ray where this distance is zero. We use Newton's method and therefore need the derivative of this function (_how does the distance to the surface change if you sweep along the ray?_) which leads us to the above formulas. 

So now we have all components ready to perform our Newton iterations! As this blog's purpose is to share stories about bugs, i won't pamper you with the boring screenshots of the correctly implemented algorithm at work, but rather with screenshots of its broken ancestors!
You need to believe me here that in the meantime, i managed to get it working. In my first empirical tests, i get away with only two Newton iterations, which is way cheaper than the 100-200 raymarch iterations! As i programmed all this on cpu side, a gpu implementation is the next step. The reason why i want to do all this is to get some realtime indirect diffuse illumination! More about this in another post. Anyways, involved spherical harmonics can lead to beautiful but buggy results like the following.

I like especially this one as it suggests some kind of spatiality:

If i remember correctly, the above came up while trying to render the spherical harmonics basis functions themselves.

The following hit me when i tried out my analytical spherical harmonics differentiation on Suzanne (didn't get far, i used the poor man's delta explained above in the end).
